# Release Day

Quantatainment have developed the world's first videogame running on a quantum computer, titled ALPHADOOM. Release day is tomorrow, and with only one QA tester remaining, launch day is hinged on a final sprint of bug fixes. 

What could possibly go wrong?

------------------------------------------------------------------

Play as Alex, a downtrodden QA Tester, on his way to get a coffee as the real world and game universe start to meld as one, traversing game bugs with the help of your (sometimes quite unhelpful) colleagues.

# Origins

Release Day was made for [Comp-3 Jam Butty 2020 - Bugs](https://itch.io/jam/comp-3-jam-butty-01), a game jam hosted by [Comp-3 Interactive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC26kmK523wCy9RziFrvhp7g), a youtube channel that specialises in Unity game development tutorials.

Release Day was declared the winner out of 6 entries due to achieving the highest community rating. You can check out the other entries on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/comp-3-jam-butty-01/entries).

# Code

Release Day was made using Unity 2019.4.12f1, but will probably be openable in later versions of unity as well. Release Day uses [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) for 2d animation.
